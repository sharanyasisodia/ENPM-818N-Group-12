### Git Help
- `git stash`: Temporarily stores all modified tracked files.
- `git pull --rebase`: Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and applies your changes on top of them.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: checks out the branch created on UI or already created branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
- `git push origin <branch-name>`: Pushes your local changes to the remote repository.
